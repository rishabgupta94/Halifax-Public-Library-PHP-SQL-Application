# Halifax-Public-Library-PHP-SQL-Application

The project was focused to improve the existing database design of the library. The library has the data about various magazine publications, their customers and monthly expenses of the employees. The library has come up with three immediate plans.
o	To record all articles for each magazine
o	To record transaction history
o	To record monthly expenses
An EER diagram was created to understand all the data requirements and identify the entities, relationships and its attributes. All the relations were normalized to 3NF and a relational database schema was created. The raw data was available in json formats which was cleaned and then imported into the newly created SQL tables. A PHP web application was created to allow the users to access the database.
The library employees can now conveniently record the books/magazines issued, access articles and fetch the customer details. The payroll team can fetch the employee details and their daily logged work hours for easy payroll.
A presentation was prepared to communicate the newly added features and services explaining the technical and the non-technical aspects of the update to cater to all kinds of audiences. A document was created to explain and highlight the work done in an elaborative manner and to provide a proof of traceability and reference.
